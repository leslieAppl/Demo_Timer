## Feature

* Run Background

>Demo_Timer does not have background process. If you terminate the process or even shutdown the device, Demo_Timer still counts time correctly. 
>Demo_Timer records users' operations in **UserDefaults**, it compares the current time and start time to calculate displayed time when you are using.
